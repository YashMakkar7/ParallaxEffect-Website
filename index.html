        <p class="text">
          Soul Society (尸魂界ソウル・ソサエティ, Souru Sosaeti; Japanese for
          "Dead Spirit World") is an afterlife (also called the spirit world).
          This is also where Shinigami live and where most Souls dwell until
          they are reincarnated into the Human World.
          <br /><br />
          Shinigami enter and leave Soul Society by unlocking the Senkaimon and
          using a Jigokuchō.[6] Pluses, on the other hand, enter Soul Society
          through the ritual of Konsō.[7] When people die, they are assigned a
          number to a part of Soul Society according to when they died.[8]
          Spirits can be born in Soul Society as much as in the living world,
          with the Shinigami acting to balance the souls.[9]

          The First Division (一番隊, ichiban-tai; "Squad 1" in the English Dub)
          is one of the Gotei 13, formerly headed by Captain Genryūsai Shigekuni
          Yamamoto and currently headed by Captain Shunsui Kyōraku.

          1st Division Barracks.Like all the other barracks, the 1st Division
          Barracks house the offices and living quarters of the Shinigami of the
          1st Division. In addition, due to the 1st Division being the division
          of the Captain-Commander, the barracks hosts the assembly hall where
          the captains gather for their meeting. The barracks also has a room
          set aside for lieutenants' meeting. Captain-Commander Shunsui's office
          within the barracks commands a wide, sweeping view of Seireitei.

          <h2 class="desc">Kurosaki Ichigo</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Ichigo Kurosaki (黒崎 一護, Kurosaki Ichigo) is a Human who is also a
          Substitute Shinigami. Ichigo is the son of Isshin and Masaki Kurosaki,
          and older brother of Karin and Yuzu. He is also married to Orihime
          Inoue and has a son named Kazui Kurosaki.

          <br /><br />
          After training at the Soul King Palace, Ichigo wears his standard
          black shihakushō, but with some notable changes: he has two white
          shoulder plates crossing his chest in an X shape that hold his Shikai
          blades in place, with the first plate on his left shoulder having
          three sections adorned with red scales, the second plate having three
          sections adorned with red scales on his right waist,[20] and a white
          cloak with black markings tied around his waist.[21]

          <h2 class="desc">Kenpachi Zaraki</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Kenpachi Zaraki (更木 剣八, Zaraki Kenpachi) is the current captain of
          the 11th Division in the Gotei 13. He is the eleventh Kenpachi to hold
          the position.[3] His first lieutenant was Yachiru Kusajishi and his
          current lieutenant is Ikkaku Madarame.

          <br /><br />
          Although he is known to be a violent man who fights for his own
          interest, Zaraki's actions tend to be for the best. Zaraki lives for
          battle, and enjoys a good fight more than anything. He even holds back
          in an effort to make any fight last longer. He claims injury and death
          are nothing but the price one pays for a good fight. Despite his
          tendency to be brutal, Zaraki usually stops a fight if his opponent is
          too injured to fight back, not interested in fighting "weaklings who
          can't fight anymore"

          <h2 class="desc">Byakuya Kuchiki</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Byakuya Kuchiki (朽木 白哉, Kuchiki Byakuya) is the 28th head of the
          Kuchiki Clan, one of the four great noble clans in Soul Society. He is
          also the captain of the 6th Division in the Gotei 13. His previous
          lieutenant was Ginjirō Shirogane and his current lieutenant is Renji
          Abarai.

          <br /><br />
          Byakuya has slate gray eyes and long black hair, which he keeps up in
          intricate white headpieces called kenseikan (牽星箝, Pulled Star
          Insert; Viz "Pull Star Silence"), which symbolize his nobility as the
          head of the Kuchiki Clan, wearing three on top of his head and another
          two on the right side. In addition to the standard captain shihakushō,
          he wears a white scarf, which is woven by the master weaver Tsujishirō
          Kuroemon III.

          <h2 class="desc">Sōsuke Aizen</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Sōsuke Aizen is the former captain of the 5th Division in the Gotei
          13. He later leaves Soul Society with his followers, Gin Ichimaru and
          Kaname Tōsen. His lieutenant was Momo Hinamori. He formerly served as
          the lieutenant of the 5th Division under Shinji Hirako. After waging
          war against Soul Society with an army of Arrancar, Aizen was defeated
          by Ichigo Kurosaki and sealed away by Kisuke Urahara, and then
          imprisoned for his crimes.

          <br /><br />
          Aizen is a polite, soft-spoken intellectual, often addressing his
          subordinates by their given names.[9][10][11][12] He rarely shows any
          sign of alarm or distress, and often has entire situations planned out
          well in advance. Whenever confronted, Aizen is casual and uncaring,
          attempting to draw out a conversation and make small talk, which often
          infuriates those he is talking to.
